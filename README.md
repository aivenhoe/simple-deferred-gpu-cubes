## generative geometry and shadows 

generative and gpu instantiated geometry seemed easy, though I always wanted to be able to add shadows to the scene.
For me this was an interesting project to learn about deferred lightning and unity's rendering pipeline with its command buffers.

Tested on Win10 with unity 2019.2.0.a14.

[keijiro](https://github.com/keijiro "keijiro") and [przemyslawzaworski](https://github.com/przemyslawzaworski/Unity3D-CG-programming "przemyslawzaworski") and their snippets were very inspirational, but [this thread by CustomPhase](https://www.reddit.com/r/Unity3D/comments/b0deyv/your_obligatory_daily_grass_shader_showoff/ "this thread by CustomPhase") helped quite a bit.
