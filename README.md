generative geometry seemed easy, though I always wanted to be able to add shadows to the scene.
For me this was an interesting project to learn about deferred lightning and unity's rendering pipeline with its command buffers.

[keijiro](https://github.com/keijiro "keijiro") and [przemyslawzaworski](https://github.com/przemyslawzaworski/Unity3D-CG-programming "przemyslawzaworski") and their snippets were very inspirational, but [this thread by CustomPhase](https://www.reddit.com/r/Unity3D/comments/b0deyv/your_obligatory_daily_grass_shader_showoff/ "this thread by CustomPhase") helped quite a bit.
